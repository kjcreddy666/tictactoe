## Description
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that can be played by two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid and the players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on the grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins the game. If all the cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
